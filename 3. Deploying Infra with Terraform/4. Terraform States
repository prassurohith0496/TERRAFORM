1. Terraform States:
=====================
State File:
===========
- After the deployment is finished terraform creates a state file to keep track of current 
  state of the infrastructure.

- It will use this file to compare when you deploy/destroy resources in other words it compares
  current state with desired state using this file.

- A File with a name of "terraform.tfstate" will be created in your working directory.

Example: if ur infra is diff from "terraform configs" its a current state now terraform will tries to get ur infra into "terraform config"  
         its knows as desired state.

1.Desired State:
-------------------
- Terraforms Primary function is to create, modify, and destroy infrastructure resources to match the desired state described in a Terraform 
  Configuration.

2. Current State:
------------------
- current state is the actual state of resource that is currently deployed. 

Important:     Current State ----------------->> Get Back Desired State.
---------- 
- Terraform tries to ensure that the deployed infrastructure is based on the desired state.
- If there is a difference between the two terraform plan presents a description of the changes necessary to acheive the desired state.

3. What is Terraform refresh?
------------------------------
-The terraform refresh command reads the current settings from all managed remote objects and updates the Terraform state to match. 
 Warning: This command is deprecated, because its default behavior is unsafe if you have misconfigured credentials for any of your providers.

# terraform refresh
