1. Destroying Infra with Terraform:
====================================
- Destroying resources is important -not in production
- if you keep the infra running, you will get charged fpor it.
- Hence it is important for us to also know on how we can delete the infrastructure resources created via terraform.

# " terraform destroy " allows us to destroy all the resources that are created within folder.

Target Option for destroy:
----------------------------
- terraform destroy with -target flag allows us to destroy specific resources.

example: # trraform destroy -target aws_instance.myec2

- The target option can be used to focus terraform attention on only a subnet of resources
  
Combination of: Resource type + Local Resource Name

Example:
---------

resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
 ami = "ami_id_XXXXXXXX"
 instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

Note:  please comment terraform files if not needed otherwise "terraform  plan command "will  will recreate resources.
