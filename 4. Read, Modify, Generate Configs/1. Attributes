1.Attributes & Output Values:
==============================
- Terraform has capability to o/p the attribute of a resource with the output values.

Example:
--------
ec2_public_ip = 35.161.21.197
bucket_identifier=terraform-test-kplabs.s3.amazonaws.com

Note:
------
- An outputed attributes can not only be used for the user reference but it can also act as a input to other 
  resources being created via terraform.
- Ex: After EIP gets created, its IP address should automatically get whitelisted in the security group.

Example-1:
----------
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "PUT-YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-HERE"
  secret_key = "PUT-YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
}

resource "aws_eip" "lb" {
  vpc      = true
}

output "eip" {
  value = aws_eip.lb
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mys3" {
  bucket = "kplabs-attribute-demo-001"
}

output "mys3bucket" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.mys3
}




2. Cross Account Resource Attributes:
=====================================
- An outputed attributes can not only be used for the user reference but it can also act as a input to poother 
  resources being created via terraform.

Example:
--------
- After EIP gets created, its IP address should automatically get whitelisted in the security group.

------>> 34.20.50.19 ------->>Firewall.

Example:1
-----------
- EIP and EC2 Instance. 
Example: 2
------------
- EIP and Security Group.
-----------------------------------------------

Example:
---------

provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "PUT-YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-HERE"
  secret_key = "PUT-YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
}


resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
   ami = "ami-082b5a644766e0e6f"
   instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_eip" "lb" {
  vpc      = true
}

resource "aws_eip_association" "eip_assoc" {
  instance_id   = aws_instance.myec2.id
  allocation_id = aws_eip.lb.id
}


resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
  name        = "kplabs-security-group"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["${aws_eip.lb.public_ip}/32"]

#    cidr_blocks = [aws_eip.lb.public_ip/32]
  }
}
